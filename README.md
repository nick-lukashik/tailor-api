# tailor-api

The API of Tailor: a vacancy in, a CV and a cover letter for it out, and the application tracked until an offer or a refusal. Its web app is [`tailor-web`](https://github.com/nick-lukashik/tailor-web) on `tailor.<domain>`; this API is internal to it, except the CV files on `cv.<domain>`.

Created from [`nest-starter`](https://github.com/nick-lukashik/nest-starter) (`.template-version`). Now a skeleton: the `applications` module (Postgres, three demo rows from migration `0001_demo_data`) and the `cv` module (one demo PDF). The pipeline, the CV files and sign-in come with the logic.

Redis, RabbitMQ (events through outbox/inbox) and pg-boss (jobs) are not here. When a feature needs one, copy it from [`nest-example`](https://github.com/nick-lukashik/nest-example) ("Add a capability" below). The shared code in `src/common/` is identical to the starter's, so a fix there is ported from the starter (`.github` `docs/templates.md`).

## Routes in prod

| Host | Reaches | How |
| ---- | ------- | --- |
| `cv.<domain>/<code>` | `GET /api/v1/cv/<code>` only | the gitops IngressRoute rewrites every path to `/api/v1/cv/...`, so nothing else of the API is public |
| none | everything else | `tailor-web` calls `http://tailor-api.prod.svc` from its server (`/api` proxy, GET only for now) |

Versions are pinned exactly. [Renovate](https://docs.renovatebot.com/) (`renovate.json`, the same policy in every repo) opens update PRs on Monday early morning (`Asia/Tbilisi`): one PR for all non-major updates, one per major, weekly lockfile maintenance. Releases younger than 3 days are skipped.

## Getting started

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm infra:up        # Postgres :5432 (app/app)
pnpm env:local       # .env from .env.example
pnpm db:migrate      # build + Drizzle migrations
pnpm dev             # http://localhost:4000, metrics http://localhost:9464/metrics
```

The rest:

```sh
pnpm verify          # lint + typecheck + build + test (Testcontainers need Docker)
pnpm test:unit       # no Docker
pnpm test:int        # Postgres in Testcontainers
pnpm start           # node dist/main.js after pnpm build
pnpm infra:down      # stop; pnpm infra:reset stops and deletes the data
```

Swagger UI: `/docs` (except with `NODE_ENV=production`), document: `/openapi.json`.

## API

Prefix `/api`, version in the URI. The `x-request-id` header is accepted (if well-formed) or generated, and returned; `x-app-version` is `APP_VERSION`. CORS is off: browsers reach the API only through the web app's server.

| Method and path                         | Response                                                      |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET /api/v1/applications?limit=20&cursor=…` | `{ items: Application[], nextCursor: string \| null }`, newest first |
| `GET /api/v1/applications/:id`          | `Application` or 404                                          |
| `POST /api/v1/applications` `{ company, role?, vacancyUrl?, vacancyText? }` | 201 `Application` (status `new`) |
| `GET /api/v1/cv/:code`                  | the PDF inline, `no-store`, `noindex`; 404 for an unknown code. Mock: only `demo` |
| `GET /health/live`, `GET /health/ready` | ready: 503 without Postgres                                   |
| `GET /openapi.json`, `GET /docs`        | OpenAPI from the Zod schemas                                  |

Error body: `{ code, message, details?: { path, message }[], requestId }` with `code` one of `VALIDATION_FAILED` (400), `NOT_FOUND` (404), `PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE` (413, body over 1 MiB), `RATE_LIMITED` (429), `INTERNAL` (500), `UNAVAILABLE` (503: Postgres over a time budget or down, retry later), `TIMEOUT` (504: the request exceeded 10 s; a write may still have been applied).

## Add a capability

Each one is a copy from `nest-example`, wired in `app.module.ts`. Pick by need ("Which mechanism" in its README): a job for this service's own background work, an event to tell other services, a consumer to react to theirs. Do not add one "for later".

| Capability                                  | Copy from nest-example                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Also                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Copy the tests of the capability too (`test/*.int.test.ts` of nest-example: `redis-degradation`, `messaging`, `broker-outage` and the helpers in `test/containers.ts`). The degradation metrics they export already have alerts in gitops (`platform/monitoring/rules/services.yaml`). A new secret goes to the service's SealedSecret.

## Time budgets

A dependency that hangs fails the request fast instead of filling the pool (service contract, "Time budgets"):

| Budget                               | Value                      | Where                                                                                               | When exceeded                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Whole request                        | 10 s                       | `RequestTimeoutInterceptor` (`src/common/http/request-timeout.ts`)                                  | 504 `TIMEOUT`; `http_server_request_timeouts_total`                                                     |
| SQL statement                        | 5 s                        | `statement_timeout`, a startup parameter of every pool connection (`DATABASE_TIMEOUTS`)             | 503 `UNAVAILABLE`                                                                                       |
| Waiting for a lock                   | 2 s                        | `lock_timeout` (row and table locks, e.g. a migration's `ALTER TABLE`)                              | 503 `UNAVAILABLE`                                                                                       |

| Waiting for a pool connection        | 2 s                        | `connectionTimeoutMillis`; the pool is bounded by `DATABASE_POOL_MAX` (10)                          | 503 `UNAVAILABLE` ("Database is busy")                                                                  |
| Request body                         | 1 MiB                      | the JSON and urlencoded body parsers (`BODY_LIMIT` in `src/app.setup.ts`), also chunked             | 413 `PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE`                                                                                 |
| Migration waiting for a lock         | 1 s per run, up to 10 runs | `lock_timeout` of the migration connection (`MIGRATION_LOCKS` in `src/common/database/database.ts`) | the run is rolled back and repeated after 1–10 s; after about 1 min the Job fails and the rollout stops |

503s from Postgres are logged with the reason only (never the SQL) and counted in `http_server_database_failures_total{reason}`; `db_pool_connections{state=total|idle|waiting}` shows the pool. Postgres also has a 6 s client reply deadline: a connection whose server never replies is closed and removed from the pool. Readiness (`/health/ready`) requires Postgres; a capability added later registers its own check, degradable ones with `required: false`.

## Migrations

`node dist/db/migrate.js` runs in the migrate Job before the new pods, while the old pods keep serving. So:

- **Compatible with the running code.** The old version runs during the Job, during the rollout and after a rollback. Add first (a column, a table, an index), switch the code in the next release, remove the old in the release after that. Never rename or drop in the same release that stops using it.
- **Forward only.** There are no down migrations; a rollback in gitops brings back the old image, which works with the new schema because of the rule above.
- **Short locks.** A DDL statement waiting for a lock holds up every later query on that table. The migration connection waits at most 1 s, below the app's 2 s, so the app's queries get through; the run (one transaction for every pending migration) is then rolled back and repeated, up to 10 times (`MIGRATION_LOCKS`, each retry logged). Once a statement holds its lock, it holds it until the end: a rewrite of a big table or an index on it is planned on its own, not mixed into a feature migration.
- **Data in batches.** Backfilling existing rows is a job, in batches, not an `UPDATE` of the whole table in the migration.

## Docker

```sh
docker build --build-arg APP_VERSION=$(git rev-parse HEAD) -t tailor-api .
pnpm infra:up
# as in Kubernetes: read-only root filesystem, no capabilities, uid 10001
docker run --rm --read-only --tmpfs /tmp --cap-drop ALL --security-opt no-new-privileges \
  --user 10001:10001 --network tailor-api_default -p 4000:3000 -p 9464:9464 \
  -e DATABASE_URL=postgres://app:app@postgres:5432/app tailor-api
# migrations from the same image
docker run --rm --read-only --tmpfs /tmp --user 10001:10001 --network tailor-api_default \
  -e DATABASE_URL=postgres://app:app@postgres:5432/app tailor-api node dist/db/migrate.js
```

- Base `node:26.13.0-trixie-slim`. Stages: `deps` (pnpm from `packageManager`) → `build` (`dist/`) and `prod-deps` (`node_modules` without dev dependencies) → `runtime`.
- `APP_VERSION` is the only build arg: nothing environment-specific is baked in, so one image runs on stage and prod.
- App files are owned by root, the app runs as uid `10001` and writes nothing: a read-only root filesystem works, only `/tmp` is writable.
- `PORT` is 3000 in the image (the local default without it is 4000), metrics on `METRICS_PORT` 9464. `HEALTHCHECK` polls `/health/ready` for `docker run`; Kubernetes ignores it and uses its probes.
- `node dist/main.js` is PID 1. On `SIGTERM`: readiness answers 503 for `SHUTDOWN_DELAY_MS` (0 by default; the pod's `preStop` sleep drains the load balancer), then HTTP and the pool close. A hard deadline in `main.ts` exits with an error after 25 s, before Kubernetes kills the pod at 30 s.
- Behind an ingress set `TRUST_PROXY_HOPS=1`, or client IPs are the proxy's.

## CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` calls the org reusable workflows from `nick-lukashik/.github` by the moving major tag `@v1`, never `@master`:

- job `ci`: `build.yml@v1` with `kind: api` and `services: postgres`. It starts a Postgres service container, exports it as `TEST_DATABASE_URL`, runs `pnpm verify` and builds the image with `APP_VERSION=<full SHA>`; on `master` it pushes the image to GHCR and outputs its digest. A change to docs only (`docs/`, `.claude/`, `*.md` at the root) skips all of it. The required check is `ci / verify`. `publish` is on: this repository is not a template.
- job `deploy`: on `master`, when an image was pushed: `deploy-pr.yml@v1` opens the gitops PR with the new digest. Secrets are passed explicitly, never `secrets: inherit`.

`test/global-setup.ts` uses `TEST_DATABASE_URL` when it is set, else starts Postgres in Testcontainers. Plain `DATABASE_URL` is never used, because the tests truncate tables.

## Deploy

The image follows the [service runtime contract](https://github.com/nick-lukashik/.github/blob/master/docs/service-contract.md) (kind **api**); it is the source of truth for everything below.

- Image: `ghcr.io/nick-lukashik/<repo-name>`, tags `sha-<7 chars>` and the full SHA, deployed by digest only. The same image goes to stage and then to prod.
- gitops: `apps/<svc>/prod/kustomization.yaml` includes `components/service` and `components/api`, sets the host, and has one `images:` entry `ghcr.io/nick-lukashik/<svc>` with a `digest`. The deploy PR changes only that digest.
- Config through `envFrom`: non-secret values (`LOG_LEVEL`, `TRUST_PROXY_HOPS`, `DATABASE_POOL_MAX`, …) in the ConfigMap `<svc>-config`; `DATABASE_URL` in the SealedSecret `<svc>-secrets`. `PORT=3000` comes from gitops; `APP_VERSION` from the image. A bad or missing value stops the process at start.
- Migrations: `components/api` runs `node dist/db/migrate.js` as an Argo CD `Sync`-hook Job in wave 0 with the same image, config and secrets: after `<svc>-secrets` (wave -1), before the Deployment (wave 1), so a failed migration stops the rollout. See "Migrations" for the rules a migration follows.
- Probes on the `http` port: `/health/live` (the process answers) and `/health/ready` (503 without Postgres). Both return `x-app-version`, which the post-deploy smoke check waits for.
- Metrics: Prometheus text on port `9464` (`METRICS_PORT`), path `/metrics`, scraped through the ServiceMonitor from `components/api`. Never on the public `http` port.
- Callers: only Traefik and pods labelled `nick-lukashik.com/api-client: "true"` (NetworkPolicy from `components/api`).

Conventions for agents and people: `AGENTS.md`; library rules: `.claude/rules/`.
